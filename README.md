# Exoplanet-Methodology
A repository for comparing the transit and Radial Velocity Methods of Exoplanet detection. Uses NASA public data. 

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive comparison between the Transit and Radial Velocity Methods in detecting exoplanets. By utilizing datasets provided by NASA, the project aims to evaluate the advantages, disadvantages, and overall effectiveness of each method in identifying and studying exoplanetary systems.

**Methodology:**
The project will begin by collecting relevant data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive, a repository containing information on thousands of confirmed exoplanets detected through various methods. This dataset will include parameters such as planet mass, radius, orbital period, and the characteristics of the host stars.

For the Transit Method, the project will analyze light curves obtained from space telescopes such as Kepler and TESS. By studying the periodic dimming of a star's light as an exoplanet transits in front of it, key information about the exoplanet's size, orbit, and atmosphere can be deduced.

Conversely, the Radial Velocity Method involves measuring the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting exoplanet. This method allows for the determination of an exoplanet's mass and orbit parameters.

The project will employ statistical analyses, data visualization techniques, and comparative studies to assess the strengths and limitations of each method. Furthermore, it will explore how combining data from both methods can enhance our understanding of exoplanetary systems.

**Expected Outcomes:**
Through this project, we anticipate uncovering valuable insights into the capabilities of the Transit and Radial Velocity Methods in detecting and characterizing exoplanets. By comparing their performance across various parameters such as detection efficiency, sensitivity to different types of exoplanets, and observational biases, we aim to provide astronomers and researchers with a nuanced understanding of these detection techniques.

Additionally, the project may uncover opportunities for synergies between the two methods, potentially leading to more robust detection and characterization strategies for future exoplanet missions.

**Significance:**
The exploration of exoplanets represents a frontier in astronomy with profound implications for our understanding of planetary formation, habitability, and the prevalence of life in the universe. By elucidating the strengths and limitations of the Transit and Radial Velocity Methods, this project contributes to advancing our knowledge of exoplanetary systems and informs the development of future observational techniques and missions.
